MVC:
-----
architecture pattern.
It divides the project into 3 layers.
1. Model  - It deals with business logic.
2. view - it is an user interface.
3. controller.- connects model and view.(It handles user interaction logic)
The logic that handles the request must be written inside this controller class.

The Methods that we are writing inside the controller are called action methods.


When we create any controller then It will create a new class inside the controller folder.

Any class which inherits the controller class must contain controler keyword at the end.

model view  controller

model contains data

view contains user interface (output design)

(we will never talk with the view also view will not do anything by its own.
if it needs data it has to ask the controller  and controller will forward that request to the model and get data , will bind the data to the view)
controller is like intermediator or it connects model and view.)

This is controller class

  public class TestController : Controller
    {
       public ActionResult Greet()
        {
            return View();
        }
    }


This is view.
